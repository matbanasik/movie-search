What I would do with the app as next steps:
- Move API call do separate service (redux-saga or RxJS)
- Error handling
- Refactor components with the goal of separation of logic and presentational part in mind
- Add more tests and create seperate test files for each component
- Store API key in a safe way
- Include just what is needed for styling
- Add search trigger on enter click
- Investigate the API on why it's returning just one movie instead of an array
